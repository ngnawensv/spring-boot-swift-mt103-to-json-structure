This regex pattern \{1:F[0-9]{2}[A-Z]{4}[A-Z]{2}[A-Z0-9]{2}[A-Z]{1}XXX\d{10}\} matches a specific format that follows the structure of SWIFT message headers. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of each part:
Explanation of Each Part:

    \{1:F:
        Matches the literal string {1:F.
        The backslash \ escapes the { character, treating it as a literal instead of a quantifier.

    [0-9]{2}:
        Matches exactly two numeric digits.
        This is typically a version or identifier code.

    [A-Z]{4}:
        Matches four uppercase letters (A-Z).
        Often represents the bank code, identifying the institution sending or receiving the message.

    [A-Z]{2}:
        Matches two uppercase letters.
        Represents the country code, indicating the country of the institution.

    [A-Z0-9]{2}:
        Matches two alphanumeric characters (either uppercase letters A-Z or digits 0-9).
        This usually represents the location code, providing additional details about the specific branch or office.

    [A-Z]{1}:
        Matches exactly one uppercase letter.
        This might indicate a specific branch code or other identifier.

    XXX:
        Matches the literal string XXX.
        In SWIFT codes, this often indicates the primary office or main branch.

    \d{10}:
        Matches exactly 10 digits (0-9).
        This section typically represents a unique identifier or a sequence number in SWIFT messages.

    \}:
        Matches the literal closing brace }, escaping it with \ to treat it as a character.
